      The PSF concluded the year having sent $91,000 to support the cooperative movement, an all time high that
      couldn't have been done without you. The funds went to purchasing greenhouses, irrigation networks, farming
      tools, and more, but most importantly it helped employ stranded Gazans in the West Bank at the cooperatives
      to protect their livelihood and dignity while their loved ones in Gaza faced the ongoing genocide.

      Cohosted by the Palestinian Social Fund, the Popular Art Center,

      ecological practices as a form of popular resistance and steadfastness
      against the exploitation, liberalization and destruction of our natural
      resources and economy at the hands of the Zionist regime.
      
      The path to liberation is through our people’s struggle to remain steadfast 
      on their land. Our deep-rooted connection to our land enables us to fight for
      full liberation and return! ✊ 🇵🇸`,
