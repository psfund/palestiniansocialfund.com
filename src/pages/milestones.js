      The PSF concluded the year having sent $91,000 to support the cooperative movement, an all time high that
      couldn't have been done without you. The funds went to purchasing greenhouses, irrigation networks, farming
      tools, and more, but most importantly it helped employ stranded Gazans in the West Bank at the cooperatives
      to protect their livelihood and dignity while their loved ones in Gaza faced the ongoing genocide.
