      `The Youth Partnership Forum organized the "Cooperative Work" camp (مخيم العمل التعاوني), with the participation
      of more than 50 participants representing 17 youth and women's cooperative groups and associations
      from different municipalities of the country. The goal of the camp is to provide a space for dialogue,
      mutual learning and teamwork between the participating cooperatives upon 4 main axes: identity and
      cooperative thought, internal documentation of operations, marketing, joint work and inter-cooperation across
      cooperatives. The camp came out with general conceptions and frameworks for visions and plans to enhance
      these four fronts as important collective economic and social forces in the Palestinian context with its national,
      economic and social dimensions. The Palestinian Social Fund also participated in the camp by sending one our volunteers
      to the camp in Palestine as well as ran a teach-in over Zoom about the Mondragon cooperative in Basque Country, Spain.`,

This excitement from the community brings us joy and pushes us to continue with even more motivation, and the people’s belief in supporting youth cooperatives is what we need to fulfill our economic and social goals: the community is spreading the word, placing orders in advance, and others pass by to buy and support all the cooperatives at the market. And if produce is left unsold, all the cooperatives join forces to find a way to sell it.",
