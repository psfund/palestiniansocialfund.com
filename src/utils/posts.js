      In the continuing genocide on the Palestinian people in Gaza, over 2000 Gazan workers have been stranded in the West Bank, unable to return to their families who are under the constant bombardment of the occupation.
      <br /><br />
      These workers have been staying in the streets or hosted at families’ homes, with no income or way back home. The PSF sought to raise money to get some of them involved in the farming coops during their time in the West Bank and provide an income that gives them the ability to move around or top up their phone plan to speak to their families in Gaza.
      <br /><br />
      We hit our goal for $20,000 providing work for 10 Gazans for 5 months at several farming coops. Without the existence of the coops, this campaign wouldn’t have been possible. The coops are spaces which provide work opportunities, social security, and most importantly pave the way toward food sovereignty. And this first campaign of its kind proves the ability of the coops to be essential and productive spaces in the struggle for liberation.

    <br />
    Over 2000 Gazan workers have been thrown into the West Bank with no money and nowhere to stay. Many have set up mattresses in the outdoors.

    In an effort to ensure the livelihood and dignity of the workers, the farming cooperatives want to provide work to unemployed Gazans and the PSF is raising funds to subsidize their income.

    We will be able to support 10 workers for 5 months if we reach our 20k goal. Any surplus will support more workers.

Wael Al-Faqih said that the idea was inspired by the First Intifada in 1987, when the culture of return to the land and social solidarity was strengthened, and it was a pioneering experience that formed a model in the concepts of steadfastness. Al-Faqih added that in light of the deteriorating economic conditions we are living in today and the developments taking place on the ground, this project was developed so that ten rural sites are targeted and seedlings and seeds are distributed to women who own agricultural space.`,

      Nearing the close of 2022, the support poured in and we raised 6000 USD to support the cooperative farms in Palestine. A warm salute to all the supporters for their uncompromising solidarity ✊
      <br />
      <br />
      Ard Al Ya’s أرض اليأس cooperative was looking to increase their harvest for the coming season and needed a greenhouse to do so. The PSF contributed the amount raised to them and they covered the rest to fulfill the purchase of 1/2 dunum greenhouse for 7000 USD. Learn more about their journey in the post. 
      <br />
      <br />
      As you can see, things aren’t cheap and our support can propel the agricultural cooperative movement forward faster. Ard Al Ya’s is one coop—there are many others doing great work in their communities that we can support.
      <br />
      <br />
      And we repeat: the quest for food sovereignty and return to land cultivation is inseparable from liberation. It is a direct refusal to work in settlements and an alternative to the occupation’s produce that floods our markets.
      <br />
      <br />
      Our next campaign will be announced soon, stay tuned and spread the word.

      cooperative thought, internal documentation of operations, marketing, joint work and inter-cooperation across
      cooperatives. The camp came out with general conceptions and frameworks for visions and plans to enhance
      these four fronts as important collective economic and social forces in the Palestinian context with its national,
      economic and social dimensions. The Palestinian Social Fund also participated by sending one of our volunteers
