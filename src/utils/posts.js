      of more than 50 participants representing 17 youth and women's cooperative groups and associations
      from different municipalities of the country. The goal of the camp is to provide a space for dialogue,
      mutual learning and teamwork between the participating cooperatives upon 4 main axes: identity and
      cooperative thought, internal documentation of operations, marketing, joint work and inter-cooperation across
      cooperatives. The camp came out with general conceptions and frameworks for visions and plans to enhance
      these four fronts as important collective economic and social forces in the Palestinian context with its national,
      economic and social dimensions. The Palestinian Social Fund also participated by sending one of our volunteers
      to the camp in Palestine as well as running a teach-in over Zoom about the Mondragon cooperative in Basque Country, Spain.`,
