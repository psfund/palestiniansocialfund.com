      In the continuing genocide on the Palestinian people in Gaza, over 2000 Gazan workers have been stranded in the West Bank, unable to return to their families who are under the constant bombardment of the occupation.
      <br /><br />
      These workers have been staying in the streets or hosted at families‚Äô homes, with no income or way back home. The PSF sought to raise money to get some of them involved in the farming coops during their time in the West Bank and provide an income that gives them the ability to move around or top up their phone plan to speak to their families in Gaza.
      <br /><br />
      We hit our goal for $20,000 providing work for 10 Gazans for 5 months at several farming coops. Without the existence of the coops, this campaign wouldn‚Äôt have been possible. The coops are spaces which provide work opportunities, social security, and most importantly pave the way toward food sovereignty. And this first campaign of its kind proves the ability of the coops to be essential and productive spaces in the struggle for liberation.

    Over 200 thousand have been out of work for the last 4 months after being banned from working in the ‚Äò48 territories and the settlements. This has caused a ripple effect of instability in West Bank‚Äôs economy.

    <br />
    Over 2000 Gazan workers have been thrown into the West Bank with no money and nowhere to stay. Many have set up mattresses in the outdoors.

    <br />
    In an effort to ensure the livelihood and dignity of the workers, the farming cooperatives want to provide work to unemployed Gazans and the PSF is raising funds to subsidize their income.

    We will be able to support 10 workers for 5 months if we reach our 20k goal. Any surplus will support more workers.
