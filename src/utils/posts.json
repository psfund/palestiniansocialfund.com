This means that we are happy and always motivated to continue and with more strength, and people’s belief in the necessity of the success of youth cooperatives, their support and the purchase of a Palestinian product is the nature of the calculation in its economic and social dimension: You find people claiming and publishing for the Hesba! And people are calling to get them of all kinds on the side! And people are going through all the cooperatives to buy and support everyone! And there are other people and cooperatives, and if a particular product increases to another, it exhausts their worries and begins to think and work on how to help with this issue! We are waiting for you on Tuesday the 24th of the month, with new and fresh products and lower prices this time also, Watermelon, molokhia, peas, onions, potatoes, baladi eggs, ewes’ dairy, baladi garlic, eggplant, zucchini, zucchini, zucchini, and regular, ...., and many other things too, in short, the home ration that you buy all from Hisbah.",

The cooperative includes 6 people (3 young men and 3 girls), who planted a land area of 5 dunams with wheat, and recently a plot of land was rehabilitated and planted with squash and zucchini seedlings. Here, we extend our thanks to the individuals and partner cooperatives who donated to support the cooperative in covering part of their needs in rehabilitating and cultivating the land. Hand in hand towards strengthening the youth collaborative work model",
