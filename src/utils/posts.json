And people are calling to get them of all kinds on the side! And people are going through all the cooperatives to buy and support everyone! And there are other people and cooperatives, and if a particular product increases to another, it exhausts their worries and begins to think and work on how to help with this issue! We are waiting for you on Tuesday the 24th of the month, with new and fresh products and lower prices this time also, Watermelon, molokhia, peas, onions, potatoes, baladi eggs, ewes’ dairy, baladi garlic, eggplant, zucchini, zucchini, zucchini, and regular, ...., and many other things too, in short, the home ration that you buy all from Hisbah.",
